# restaurant-review-app

This is a project within the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree where the task was to convert a static website into a mobile-ready web application. Areas of focus are mobile responsiveness for different screen sizes, standard accessibility features for screen reader use and offline functionality. 

### What is the app about?

The website serves as a guide for restaurants in New York. It is possible to filter for neighboorhoods and cuisines. The restaurant view shows more details such as opening hours and also customer reviews. 

### How to access the app?

- Download or clone the repo. 
    1. Start up a simple HTTP server via the terminal (f.e. using Python)
    python 2.x `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` 
    python 3.x `python3 -m http.server 8000`
    2. With your local server up and running visit `http://localhost:8000`

- Check out the site online (link coming soon)
